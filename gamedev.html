            <h2>Interactive Storytelling</h2>
            <p>However, my work is not limited to fiction. In fact, my current explorations have led me to writing for video games. As this is ongoing, I do not have much to show here yet. Look forward to future updates.</p>
            
            <p>The transition from traditional writing to interactive media represents an exciting evolution in my creative journey. Games offer unique opportunities to engage audiences as active participants in the narrative rather than passive observers.</p>

            <h2>Vision & Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal in game writing is to elevate the medium's storytelling potential. I believe games can be powerful vehicles for exploring complex themes and emotions, much like literature or film.</p>
            
            <p>By combining my academic research skills, fiction writing experience, and passion for interactive media, I aim to create gaming experiences that are both entertaining and meaningful.</p>
