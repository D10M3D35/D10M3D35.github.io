            <h2>Creative Vision</h2>
            <p>So far, my fictional works have been focused on my own personal interests. I am particularly drawn to dark fantasy or high fantasy settings, where I can explore complex themes of heroism, morality, and the human condition.</p>
            
            <p>This probably comes from my academic background in history and classical literature. I strive to create believeable worlds that feel both fantastical and grounded in believable cultural and political structures.</p>

            <h2>Featured Work</h2>
            <h3>Ghosts of the Labyrinth</h3>
            <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Grimdark Science Fiction | <strong>Setting:</strong> Warhammer 40,000 Universe</p>
            
            <p>My most significant piece of work thus far is an extensive first-person narrative set in the Warhammer 40k Universe. While it is not an original work, I have found myself very passionate about the subject matter, and sought to utilize this as an practice method.</p>
            
            <div class="sample-text" style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1rem 0; border-left: 4px solid var(--ancient-gold); font-style: italic;">
                <p><em>"A crackling thrust from my spear, barely audible over the sudden silence, marked the battle's end. Corpses, both daemons and golden-clad warriors alike, littered the unnatural geometry of the approach where I now stood. Daemons and traitors. Brothers and sisters. I am alone. As I pull my weapon from the still-undulating hide of the warp beast, it disintegrates as quickly as it arrived. Is this brief respite a mercy, or a curse?"</em></p>
                
                <p><em>"We are losing."</em></p>
                
                <p><em>"Each day, the Impossible City's towering spires seemed to slip further from our grasp, like sand trickling through clenched fingers..."</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The narrative follows an ancient warrior haunted by prophetic dreams of endless warfare while investigating cultist infiltration aboard the starship "Nomad." Through five chapters, the story weaves between nightmarish visions and present-day intrigue, exploring themes of duty, sacrifice, and the psychological burden carried by humanity's immortal guardians.</p>
            
            <p>This piece demonstrates my approach to grimdark fiction: focusing on the human cost of eternal war while maintaining the iconic atmosphere and lore that defines the Warhammer 40k universe.</p>
