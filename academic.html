            <p>I have written a significant number of historical papers and dissertations on various topics ranging from American Media Consumption in a post-9/11 world to the role of the Roman Empire in shaping the indigenous populations.</p>
            
            <p>My academic work focuses on the intersection of historical events and their lasting cultural impact, examining how past civilizations and modern societies shape each other through media, politics, and social structures.</p>

            <h3>Martial Identity in the Lower Rhine: A Cultural Crossroads (70 BCE - 70 CE)</h3>
            <p><strong>Master's Thesis, University of Edinburgh</strong> | <em>August 2023</em></p>
            <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. Andrew Lamb | <strong>Program:</strong> MSc in Ancient History</p>
            
            <p>This comprehensive 15,000-word dissertation examines how martial identities evolved in the Lower Rhine region during a critical period of Roman expansion and cultural transformation. Through an integrated archaeological and historical analysis, the work explores the complex interactions between Celtic, Germanic, and Roman cultures in this frontier zone.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Key Research Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>How did local and regional martial identities change during Roman conquest and integration?</li>
                <li>Were the Romans influenced by the Celtic and Germanic groups they sought to change?</li>
                <li>What role did military service and acculturation play in identity formation?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Primary Case Studies:</strong> The research focuses on two pivotal societies - the Eburones (largely destroyed during Caesar's campaigns) and their successors, the Batavians, who became crucial to Roman military recruitment while developing their own distinct martial identity that ultimately led to the Batavian Revolt of 68-69 CE.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Combines archaeological evidence from sanctuaries at Kessel-Lith, Empel, and Elst with classical literary sources from Caesar, Tacitus, and other historians, while critically examining issues of bias and perspective in both material and written records.</p>
